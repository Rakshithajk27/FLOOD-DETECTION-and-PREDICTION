# 🌟 **Object Detection & Segmentation Models** 🚀

Welcome to the **Object Detection & Segmentation Models** repository! 🎉 This collection features **three powerful models** designed for advanced image analysis tasks:

- **YOLOv5**: Fast, real-time object detection 🕵️‍♂️
- **Mask R-CNN**: Precise instance segmentation 🎭
- **U-Net**: Semantic segmentation for pixel-wise classification 🧠

---

## 🔍 **What’s Inside?**

### 1. **YOLOv5** 🏎️
- **Real-time Object Detection**: Detects and classifies objects in images and videos, ideal for fast-paced environments.
- **Super Fast & Accurate**: Perfect for use cases where speed is crucial.

### 2. **Mask R-CNN** 🎨
- **Instance Segmentation**: Detects objects and creates pixel-perfect segmentation masks.
- **Perfect for Complex Scenes**: Works well with images containing multiple overlapping objects.

### 3. **U-Net** 🏥
- **Semantic Segmentation**: Classifies every pixel in an image into predefined categories.
- **Great for Medical & Satellite Images**: Often used in medical imaging and tasks requiring pixel-level precision.

## ⚡ **How to Use**

With each model, you'll find an interactive **Jupyter Notebook** that allows you to:
- **Run object detection or segmentation tasks** on your images and videos 📸
- **Retrain models with your own custom dataset** 💡
- **Experiment and fine-tune configurations** to get the best results 🔧

## 🔄 **Custom Dataset Integration**

Want to use your own dataset? No worries! You can easily adapt each model:

1. **YOLOv5**: 
   - Prepare your data in YOLO format (images + annotation text files).
   - Update dataset paths and classes, then run the model 🚀.
   
2. **Mask R-CNN**:
   - Format your dataset as COCO (images + JSON annotations).
   - Modify paths in the notebook and start training your custom model 🔄.
   
3. **U-Net**:
   - Use labeled images with corresponding masks.
   - Adjust dataset paths in the notebook and retrain the model 💻.
